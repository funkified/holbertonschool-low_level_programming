It is easy to be initially intimidated by pointers. Basic variable declarations in C are relatively intuitive - declare a type, specify a variable name, and define values directly using an equal (=) sign. Yet, pointers introduce an entirely different syntax that can appear strange at first - where in the world did the multiplication sign come from? And why is it being used on both sides of the equal sign?

Trust me, I’ve been there. I’ve been in your shoes, and felt that the syntax behind pointers only introduced confusion and frustration. For this same reason, I want you to take my word for it - my professor was correct. Pointers do not have to be scary!
