Two dimensional (2D) arrays in C programming with example
BY CHAITANYA SINGH | FILED UNDER: C-PROGRAMMING

An array of arrays is known as 2D array. The two dimensional (2D) array in C programming is also known as matrix. A matrix can be represented as a table of rows and columns. Before we discuss more about two Dimensional array lets have a look at the following C program.

Simple Two dimensional(2D) Array Example
For now donâ€™t worry how to initialize a two dimensional array, we will discuss that part later. This program demonstrates how to store the elements entered by user in a 2d array and how to display the elements of a two dimensional array.

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
   /* 2D array declaration*/
   int disp[2][3];
   /*Counter variables for the loop*/
   int i, j;
   for(i=0; i<2; i++) {
      for(j=0;j<3;j++) {
         printf("Enter value for disp[%d][%d]:", i, j);
         scanf("%d", &disp[i][j]);
      }
   }
   //Displaying array elements
   printf("Two Dimensional array elements:\n");
   for(i=0; i<2; i++) {
      for(j=0;j<3;j++) {
         printf("%d ", disp[i][j]);
         if(j==2){
            printf("\n");
         }
      }
   }
   return 0;
}
Output:

Enter value for disp[0][0]:1
Enter value for disp[0][1]:2
Enter value for disp[0][2]:3
Enter value for disp[1][0]:4
Enter value for disp[1][1]:5
Enter value for disp[1][2]:6
Two Dimensional array elements:
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
Initialization of 2D Array
There are two ways to initialize a two Dimensional arrays during declaration.

int disp[2][4] = {
    {10, 11, 12, 13},
    {14, 15, 16, 17}
};
OR

int disp[2][4] = { 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17};
Although both the above declarations are valid, I recommend you to use the first method as it is more readable, because you can visualize the rows and columns of 2d array in this method.
